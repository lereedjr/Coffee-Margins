Deployment
TBD

Built With
â€¢	RStudio â€“ IDE tool used with R programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
â€¢	Tableau - used for creating data visualizations, publishing data sources
â€¢	Weka - machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.
